# Task
Write a program capable of generating a list of students for physical training. The program receives as input a non-increasing sequence of natural numbers representing the height of each person in the formation. The program then processes all the values and suggests a sequence. The operator can swap people with the same height in both directions. The program should be able to add new students, remove old ones and find the right ones with the output of information about their height.
